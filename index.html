                        closest to them. So, here is an
                        “About Me” section explained by my wife.

                        My name is Brian Monda. I live in Central Missouri with my wife and two boys. On any random day,
                        you
                        will find me outside either chasing my 3 year old (who is likely half-way dressed) or playing
                        basketball
                        with my oldest. I am an outgoing introvert. I love to be around my family and friends, but to
                        recharge
                        my batteries, I prefer to be at home, in my chair, listening to my audio book. For all my
                        personality
                        test lovers: I am an Enneagram 9 (if you don’t know what this is, ask my wife) and an INTP on
                        Myers
                        Briggs.

                        Professionally, I have worked in different settings. From account management for John Deere
                        equipment to
                        home loans, but my passion has always been what you will find here: Figuring out the inner
                        dialogue to
                        make what you see on this screen or simply put, programming.

                        So in summary, I am a dad, husband, an introverted techy that is just chasing his dream to have
                        a career
                        that I am passionate about. My portfolio shows my past projects that I will be continuously
                        building on.
