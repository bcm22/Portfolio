            <p>I’ve often heard if you want to really know somebody, ask the person closest to them. So, here is an
                “About Me” section explained by my wife.

                My name is Brian Monda. I live in Central Missouri with my wife and two boys. On any random day, you
                will find me outside either chasing my 3 year old (who is likely half-way dressed) or playing basketball
                with my oldest. I am an outgoing introvert. I love to be around my family and friends, but to recharge
                my batteries, I prefer to be at home, in my chair, listening to my audio book. For all my personality
                test lovers: I am an Enneagram 9 (if you don’t know what this is, ask my wife) and an INTP on Myers
                Briggs.

                Professionally, I have worked in different settings. From account management for John Deere equipment to
                home loans, but my passion has always been what you will find here: Figuring out the inner dialogue to
                make what you see on this screen or simply put, programming.

                So in summary, I am a dad, husband, an introverted techy that is just chasing his dream to have a career
                that I am passionate about. My portfolio shows my past projects that I will be continuously building on.
