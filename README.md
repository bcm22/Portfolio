# portfolio

##Description

My motivation for this project was to lay the ground work for what will be a solid portfolio of my work. I will be building on this template as I learn new skills and complete new projects. Future projects will be listed next to the "GitHub" link. I will also be attaching a resume to the portfolio once I update my resume after I completed the course. 

From this project, I learned how to create a page that is compatiable to various screen sizes. I also learned how to create a responsive button.
